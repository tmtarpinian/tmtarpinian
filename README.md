### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Trevor. I'm a software engineer that focuses on Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React.js, and Postgres, although I'm having fun learning node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the side. I currently work as a Software Engineer technical coach for the Flatiron School, answering programming questions from software engineering students, ranging in nature from Ruby and Javascript, to Sinatra, Rails, and React.js.

I use pair programming to help students debug labs and work through dependency issues. I also help improve Readmes and Rspec tests in the Learn-co software engineering curriculum, through pull requests on Github.

These can be identified in my commits prefixed with `learn-co-students/`

Additionally, the bulk of repos with single commits are the result of working one-on-one with students, either to demonstrate how to fork a lab's repo from the Learn-co curriculum or provide me historical reference to gemfile or package.json for solving dependency issues.

These repos commonly include the word "lab" in them.

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m working on digitizing Crum's Coptic Dictionary with a Ruby on Rails backend and React.js UI. I've just begun, and chipping away slowly at night in my free time ðŸ™‚. Also working on improving my test-writing in Rspec, Jest, and Capybara.
- ðŸŒ±  Currently learning about Postman, Puppeteer, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express
